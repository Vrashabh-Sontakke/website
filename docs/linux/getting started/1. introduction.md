#### What is Linux Kernel? 

The Linux® kernel is the main component of a Linux operating system (OS) and is the core interface between a computer’s hardware and its processes. It communicates between the two, managing resources as efficiently as possible.

**The Linux Foundation** 

It's a non-profit organization that sponsors Linux and various other open source projects. 

-   Supported by individual members and large companies (Intel, TI, NXP, Oracle, etc.) 

-   Organize technical events and develop training programs 

-   Manages [kernel.org](https://www.kernel.org/) where the official versions of the Linux kernel are released 

-   Runs Linux web page [linux.com](https://www.linux.com/) 

**LINUX DISTRIBUTIONS & FAMILIES** 

FEDORA 

-   Package manager: yum or/and dnf 

-   Directly associated with Red Hat widely used by enterprises which host their own systems. 

-   Examples: Fedora, RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux), Centos 

DEBIAN 

-   Widely used for servers and desktop 

-   Focuses on stability 

-   Package manager: DPKG-based apt-get 

-   Ubuntu uses Unity, a GUI based on GNOME. It has very small memory footprint and is widely used for cloud deployments. 

-   Examples: Ubuntu 

SUSE 

-   Package manager: zypper 

-   Widely used in the retail/sales sector (Ex clothing stores, supermarkets). 

-   Examples: SUSE, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), OpenSUSE

**INTRODUCTION**

-   Linux was written to be a free and open source version of UNIX.
-   "All is a file": Linux makes its components available via files or objects that look like files. so it can be used with the same utilities used for regular files.

-   Processes, devices, and network sockets are all represented by file-like objects
-   In Linux all files are stored in one united directory tree, starting at "/", the system's root directory

-   Kernel: The core of the OS, it controls the HW and makes the HW interact with the Apps.
-   Boot Loader: Program that boots/loads the OS (which is just another program). Bootloader Examples: GRUB and ISOLINUX.
-   Service: Program that runs as a background process known as daemons.
-   File System: Method for storing and organizing files (Ex. FAT, NTFS, ext3, ext4, etc).
-   X Window System: Provides the toolkit and protocol to build GUIs
-   The desktop enviroment: is a GUI on top of the OS. Ex. GNOME, Xfce, KDE...
-   Shell: is a command line interpreter

**DISTRIBUTION**

A Linux Distro is combination of the kernel Linux with other system components or programs to make a Linux based OS. The programs are used for:

-   File-related operations
-   User management
-   Software package management.
