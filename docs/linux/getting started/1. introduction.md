### What is Linux Kernel?
The Linux kernel is the main component of a Linux operating system (OS) and is the core interface between a computer’s hardware and its processes. It communicates between the two, managing resources as efficiently as possible.

### The Linux Foundation
It's a non-profit organization that sponsors Linux and various other open source projects. 
 -  Supported by individual members and large companies (Intel, TI, NXP, Oracle, etc.) 
 -  Organize technical events and develop training programs 
 -  Manages [`kernel.org`](https://www.kernel.org/) where the official versions of the Linux kernel are released 
 -  Runs Linux web page [`linux.com`](https://www.linux.com/)

### Linux Distributions & Families
A Linux Distro is the combination of the kernel of Linux with other system components or programs to make a Linux based OS. The programs are used for:
-   File-related operations
-   User management
-   Software package management.

 - FEDORA 
    - Package manager → yum or/and dnf 
    - Directly associated with Red Hat widely used by enterprises which host their own systems. 
    - Examples → Fedora, RHEL (Red Hat Enterprise Linux), CentOS 
 - DEBIAN 
    - Widely used for servers and desktop 
    - Focuses on stability 
    - Package manager → DPKG-based apt-get 
    - Ubuntu uses Unity, a GUI based on GNOME. It has a very small memory footprint and is widely used for cloud deployments. 
    - Examples → Ubuntu 
 - SUSE 
    - Package manager → zypper 
    - Widely used in the retail/sales sector (Ex → clothing stores, supermarkets). 
    - Examples → SUSE, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), openSUSE

### Introduction
-   Linux was written to be a free and open source version of UNIX.
-   "Everything is a file" → Linux makes its components available via files or objects that look like files. So it can be used with the same utilities used for regular files.
-   Processes, devices, and network sockets are all represented by file-like objects
-   In Linux all files are stored in one united directory tree, starting at "/", the system's root directory
-   Kernel → The core of the OS, it controls the hardware and makes the hardware interact with the Apps.
-   Boot Loader → Program that boots/loads the OS (which is just another program). Bootloader Examples: GRUB and ISOLINUX.
-   Service → Program that runs as a background process known as daemons.
-   File System → Method for storing and organizing files (Ex → FAT, NTFS, ext3, ext4, etc).
-   X Window System → Provides the toolkit and protocol to build GUIs
-   The desktop environment → is a GUI on top of the OS (Ex → GNOME, Xfce, KDE etc).
-   Shell → is a command line interpreter
